What i sPytest :
Great features :
-auto-discovery of tests:
    - pyTest has the ability to pick up tests based on the way we name them
    -no explicit registration needed 

-Rich assertion introspection :
when the test fails there is a really nice breakdown as to why that test failed , reports


-Support parameterized and fixture-based testing:
we can run test function multiple times with diff functions


WHy Pytest:
-Simplified Syntax
-Rich assertion introspection
-Powerful Fixture System(operation to run before test run)
-Compatibility
-Extensibility(rich plugin architecture , ex Django )

Assert in pythonis debugginh Aid that tests a condition as an aid to debugging


-cool things :
setup method is code that run before the test code will be executed 
run at the beggingn of each test



-- in class based test , we can use setup method to initialize test 
--- but in function test , we can use a fixture 



Marks and parametize
Marks to give pytest that things is a mark ,

parametrize to allow testing multiple pattern ! 
example : when we want to set a bulb in multiple battery , we are not testing one by one but we can use parametrize
